# Sublime Text 3 Settings
This is my current personal configuration for the Sublime Text 3 text editor.
## Instalation

Make sure that Package Control is installed. You can see how to install it [here](https://packagecontrol.io/installation)

### Linux

*Note.-* This will remove your current configuration. To save said settings, make a backup of the following folder: `~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User`.
```
rm -rf ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User
git clone https://github.com/PKGaspi/SublimeText3Settings.git ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User
```

Open Sublime and wait for every package to download.
